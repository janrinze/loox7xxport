<h1>Linux for the Loox 7xx</h1>
</div>

The Loox 710, 718 and 720 are PXA based Pocket PCs.
Quite some time ago the port was done and is still unfinished.

Work from Alexander Tarasikov has bumped us into kernel **2.6.34**!
a full copy of the git source tree is in the Downloads section.

Also check out the Android downloads. Martin has been working on those and will release sources soon. The files uploaded by Martin have been downloaded more than 1600 times already!

All accumulated development effort up to Sept 2008 is in the clone 'loox2-6-26' this can be seen as the stable kernel.
